🚀 DevOps CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Terraform & AWS
📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates a mini yet production-style DevOps project that automates application build, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment using Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, and AWS.

On every code push to GitHub, a Jenkins pipeline:

Builds a Docker image for the application

Provisions AWS infrastructure using Terraform

Deploys the containerized application on AWS EC2

This project is designed to showcase hands-on learning and real-world DevOps workflows.
